## 1. Tasks

### 1a. Open Tasks

#### 1a1. Due Tasks

#### 1a2. Other Tasks
- [ ] 1a2c. Workflow Card layout tweaks
  - 1a2c1. Icon & Title should be on same line
  - 1a2c2. Icon/Title line and button line should always be a uniform height across each card while fitting all content
  - 1a2c3. Card should display description by default; on hover, replace with feature bullet points on hover
- [ ] 1a2e. Implement Prettify utility type
  - [Prettify](https://www.totaltypescript.com/concepts/the-prettify-helper)
- [ ] 1a2g. Research and implement different models for each separate LangChain AI call
- [ ] 1a2h. Ensure components use the palette from their native workflow
  Regardless of current route, module generation is part of Metis; using a `/themis` route should show themis' palette, but individual modules that display within the page should have metis' palette applied. Eventually this will apply Tethys to arcs in themis as well.
- [ ] 1a2i. Move module code from `/api/themis/module` to `/api/metis/*`
- [ ] 1a2j. Implement test data generation with British English enforcement
  - Verify that generated modules now use British spelling
  - Test with both Metis and Themis workflows

### 1b. Blocked Tasks
<!-- No blocked tasks -->

---

## 2. MVP Milestones
- [ ] 2a. Implement Themis-style Theia previews for Metis (and Metis-in-Themis)
- [ ] 2b. Address all ARIA violations
- [ ] 2c. Update all Svelte legacy approaches and implementations to use Svelte 5

---

## 3. Beyond MVP: Future Features
- [ ] 3a. Allow defining custom research domains; this supports future generalisation of tool beyond AI engineering contexts

      - [x] 4a2c4. Human-editable (direct TypeScript objects, no build-time generation)
  - [x] 4a2d. Tailwind evaluation: **Decided against** - custom system sufficient for 5 palettes
  - **Key Changes:**
    - Moved palette definitions from `docs/dev/ref/palettes/` to `src/lib/config/palettes/`
    - Eliminated hardcoded `PALETTES` constant duplication in `paletteLoader.ts`
    - Created `paletteTransformer.ts` for transformation logic
    - Updated type definitions to match rich semantic structure
    - Removed duplicate JSON files
    - Added comprehensive documentation at `docs/dev/ref/palettes/README.md`
- [x] 4a3. British English & Emoji Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-28)

    - Integration: `src/lib/factories/prompts/{metis,themis}PromptFactory.ts`
    - Scope: All AI-generated content (objectives, topics, narratives, project briefs)

### 4b. Completed Tasks
#### 4b1. Record of Past Deadlines
- [x] 4b1a. Add dark mode to UI ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-29)
  - **Branch:** `ui/dark-mode`
  - **PR:** #30
  - **Commits:** Merged via `125797d`
  - **Summary:** Complete dark mode implementation with light/dark/system theme selection

    - CSS custom properties for theme-aware styling
    - Automatic system preference detection
    - User-selectable override (light/dark/system)
    - Persistent theme preference across sessions
  - **Impact:**
    - 1,807 insertions, 272 deletions across 31 files
    - All workflows now support dark mode
    - Comprehensive documentation in `docs/dev/features/dark-mode.md`
  - **Addresses:** Original task 1a2b

#### 4b2. Record of Other Completed Tasks
- [x] 4b2a. Create an xml output sanitiser
  - Completed via xmlCleaner.ts and responseParser.ts
- [x] 4b2c. Workflow-specific components organized correctly ✅ COMPLETED
  - Components are organized in `src/lib/components/{workflow}/` structure
  - Themis: `src/lib/components/themis/` (12 components)
  - Metis: `src/lib/components/metis/` (3 components)
  - Theia: `src/lib/components/theia/` (3 components)
  - Errors: `src/lib/components/errors/` (2 components)
  - This structure allows for workflow-specific components while maintaining reusability
  - **Note:** Moving to `src/routes/*/components` would reduce reusability; current structure is optimal
  - **Addresses:** Original task 1a2f
- [x] 4b2b. Create colour palettes for Rhea, Themis, Tethys, Metis, and Theia based on their icons
  - Initial implementation: `src/lib/styles/palettes.css` (2025-10-23)
  - Branch: `ui/module-palettes` (merged via PR #15)
  - Implemented dynamic palette system with CSS custom properties
  - Palettes initially defined for four modules: Rhea (default), Themis, Tethys, Metis
  - Applied via `data-palette` attribute on root element
  - **Theia palette added:** (2025-10-24)
    - Branch: `theia/feat/continue-session-from-xml` (PR #21)
    - Magenta/cyan colour scheme (--palette-foreground: #B0127A, --palette-foreground-alt: #11B5C6)
    - Integrated in `paletteLoader.ts` and `paletteTypes.ts`
    - All five workflow palettes now complete
